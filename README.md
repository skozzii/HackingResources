# HackingResources
HackingResources for learning in 2020.  This is a list I have curated while I have been learning how to Hack.  I have provided all links to support to creators of the content, although these resources are obviously available elsewhere.  This list will continue to change, grow and evolve as I change, grow and evolve.
